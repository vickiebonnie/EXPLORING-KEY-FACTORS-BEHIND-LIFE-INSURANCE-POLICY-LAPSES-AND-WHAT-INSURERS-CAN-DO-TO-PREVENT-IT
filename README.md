# EXPLORING-KEY-FACTORS-BEHIND-LIFE-INSURANCE-POLICY-LAPSES-AND-WHAT-INSURERS-CAN-DO-TO-PREVENT-IT

# Project Overview
Have you ever signed up for something important… but had to stop halfway because life got in the way?

It happens . And it’s surprisingly common with life insurance.

This project investigates why so many people let their life insurance policies lapse and what insurers can do to reduce it. Using a real dataset and exploratory data analysis in R, I identified key trends and proposed data-driven, real-world solutions

#️ Business Context
Life insurance is a safety net but when people stop paying their premiums, both they and the insurer lose out.

By understanding which customers are more likely to lapse and why, insurers can design better products and communication strategies to keep people protected and maintain their customer base.

This analysis focused on three main questions:

• How do lapse rates vary across different age groups?

• Does payment frequency influence lapse rates?

• Do shorter policy terms lapse more often than longer ones
