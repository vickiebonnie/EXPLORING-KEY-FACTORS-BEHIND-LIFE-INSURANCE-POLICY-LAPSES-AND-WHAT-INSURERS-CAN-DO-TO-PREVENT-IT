# EXPLORING KEY FACTORS BEHIND LIFE INSURANCE POLICY LAPSES AND WHAT INSURERS CAN DO TO PREVENT IT

# 📌Project Overview

Have you ever signed up for something important, only to stop halfway because life got in the way?

It happens. And it’s surprisingly common with life insurance.

This project investigates why so many people let their life insurance policies lapse and what insurers can do to reduce it. Using a real dataset and exploratory data analysis in R, I identified key trends and proposed data-driven, real-world solutions


# 💡Business Context

Life insurance is more than a financial product.it’s a safety net for families.
When policies lapse:

•	Customers lose critical financial protection.

•	Insurers lose revenue and customer trust.


### This analysis focused on three main questions:

• How do lapse rates vary across different age groups?

• Does payment frequency influence lapse rates?

• Do shorter policy terms lapse more often than longer ones


# 📂Dataset & Tools

📄 Data Used

Source: Life Insurance Dataset Kaggle[(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balgdrum/life-insurance-policy-data)]

### 📌Key Variables Analyzed 

•	Age

•	Payment Frequency (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually and single premium)

•	Policy Term

•	Policy Status


### 🛠Tools Used
•	Programming Language: R

•	Libraries: tidyverse, dplyr and  ggplot2

•	Techniques: Data cleaning, data transformation, grouping variables, visualization with ggplot


### 🧹Data Preparation Process

•	Removed duplicates.

•	Dropped unused columns (BENEFIT, Premium) for this analysis.

•	Filtered out ages below 18 years

### 🔄 Data Transformation 

•	Grouped ENTRY AGE into: 18–30, 31–50, 51+.

•	Grouped Policy Year into: Short (≤ 5 years) and Long (> 5 years)

•	Grouped  “Lapse”, “Surrender”, “Expired” to Lapsed and  “Inforce” to  Active



# 📊 Key Insights

Below are the main insights uncovered during the analysis, accompanied by visualizations generated in


              ###  AGE GROUP VS LAPSE RATE

•	Younger people(ages 18-30)are more likely to stop paying premiums on their policies over a period.

•	Older people(50+) are more likely to keep their policies


             ### LAPSE RATE (%) ACROSS PAYMENT FREQUENCY

• Policies paid all at once or once a year are more likely to stay active.

• Those with monthly or quarterly payments are more likely to stop paying their premiums.



























## Loading the life insurance data(kaggle) into R
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
life_insurance_data <-read_csv("life insurance data.csv")
```
## Inspecting the structure of the data
```{r}
glimpse(life_insurance_data)          ## View column types and samples     
```

## Checking  and removing duplicate
```{r}
any(duplicated(life_insurance_data))  ## check for duplicate
sum(duplicated(life_insurance_data))  ## gives the total number of duplicates in the data 
```

## Taking duplicates out of the life data 
```{r}
life_insurance_unique <-life_insurance_data[!duplicated(life_insurance_data),]   ## removing duplicate
```
## checking for missing values in life_insurance_unique data
```{r}
anyNA(life_insurance_unique)
```
## Checking to see where specifically in the data can we find the missing values 
```{r}
colSums(is.na(life_insurance_unique))   ## show  column names with count of missing values(missing values in benefits and premiums)
```

## The entry age to sign up to a life insurance policy is 18 years or more . so i removed ages less than 18 years from “life_insurance_unique” data set . 
```{r}
life_insurance_unique <- life_insurance_unique %>% filter(`ENTRY AGE` >= 18)
```


## Drop columns we won’t analyze (BENEFIT, Premium)
```{r}
life_insurance_reduced <- subset(life_insurance_unique, select = -c(BENEFIT, Premium))
```


## Rename columns for clarity
```{r}
library(dplyr)
life_insurance_reduced <- life_insurance_reduced %>%
  rename(
    age =`ENTRY AGE`,
    payment_frequency = `PAYMENT MODE`,
    policy_term =`Policy Year`)
```
## Keep a clean dataset for further processing
```{r}
life_insurance_rename = life_insurance_reduced
```

Why? Grouping continuous variables like age into categories
# makes trends easier to interpret for business decisions
```{r}
life_insurance_rename <- life_insurance_rename %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(age,
                         breaks = c(18, 30, 50, Inf),
                         labels = c("18–30", "31–50", "51+")))
```

## Renaming columnames to lowercase
```{r}
names(life_insurance_rename) <- tolower(names(life_insurance_rename))
```

## Check summary for ages 
```{r}
summary(life_insurance_rename$age_group)   ## there are missing values from the checks 
```

## Remove rows with missing age group
```{r}
life_insurance_clean <- life_insurance_rename%>%
  
  filter(!is.na(age) & age >= 18 & age <= 100) %>%
 
  mutate(age_group = cut(
    age,
    breaks = c(17, 30, 50,Inf),
    labels = c("18–30", "31–50", "51+")
  ))
```

## Policy status in  this  data is the combination of “Lapse”, “Surrender”, “Expired” ,"Death" and "Inforce".
To calculate for lapse, we need to calculate for a lapse variable 
```{r}
life_insurance_lapse <- life_insurance_clean %>%
  filter(`policy status` != "Death") %>%               
  mutate(`policy status` = case_when(
    `policy status`%in% c("Lapse", "Surrender", "Expired") ~ "Lapsed",
    `policy status` == "Inforce" ~ "Active",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))                ## Grouped  “Lapse”, “Surrender”, “Expired” to Lapsed and  “Inforce” to  Active
```

## Calculate lapse rate by age group
```{r}
lapse_rate_by_age <- lapse_by_age %>%
